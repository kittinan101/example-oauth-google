# Google OAuth Example Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Security-First Development
Security is paramount in authentication systems. All authentication flows MUST follow OAuth 2.0 best practices. Secrets MUST never be committed to version control. Environment variables MUST be used for all sensitive configuration. HTTPS MUST be enforced in production. Session tokens MUST be HTTP-only and secure.

**Rationale**: OAuth implementations handle user credentials and personal data. A single security flaw can compromise user accounts and violate trust. Security cannot be retrofitted - it must be built in from the start.

### II. Type Safety & Validation
TypeScript strict mode MUST be enabled. All API inputs MUST be validated. Type definitions MUST extend NextAuth types properly. Runtime validation MUST complement compile-time types.

**Rationale**: Authentication systems require reliability. Type safety catches errors at compile time. Input validation prevents injection attacks and data corruption. Together they create defense in depth.

### III. Developer Experience
Documentation MUST be complete and accurate. Setup MUST work with minimal configuration. Error messages MUST be actionable. Examples MUST be tested and working.

**Rationale**: This is a demonstration project. Its primary value is educational. If developers cannot understand or run it easily, the project fails its purpose.

### IV. Test Coverage for Critical Paths
Authentication flows MUST have integration tests. OAuth callback handling MUST be tested. Session management MUST be verified. Security features MUST have test coverage.

**Rationale**: Authentication bugs can lock users out or expose security vulnerabilities. Automated tests catch regressions before they reach users. Critical paths require higher test standards than feature code.

### V. Production Readiness
Deployment guides MUST be current. Environment variable validation MUST exist. Error handling MUST be comprehensive. Monitoring hooks MUST be available.

**Rationale**: Example projects often get deployed to production. Missing production considerations create security risks and operational failures. Better to include them from the start.

## Development Standards

### Code Quality
- ESLint MUST pass with no errors
- TypeScript MUST compile with no errors in strict mode
- Components MUST follow React best practices (hooks, server/client separation)
- API routes MUST handle errors gracefully
- Unused code MUST be removed before commits

### Documentation Requirements
- README MUST include complete setup instructions
- API endpoints MUST be documented (OpenAPI preferred)
- Environment variables MUST be documented with examples
- Troubleshooting section MUST address common issues
- Security considerations MUST be explicitly called out

### Dependency Management
- Dependencies MUST be kept up to date
- Security vulnerabilities MUST be addressed promptly
- Breaking changes MUST be documented in upgrade guides
- Deprecated packages MUST be replaced or justified

## Quality Gates

### Pre-Commit
- Code MUST be formatted (Prettier/built-in formatter)
- Linting MUST pass (ESLint)
- Types MUST be valid (TypeScript compiler)

### Pre-Deployment
- Build MUST succeed without warnings
- Critical user flows MUST be manually verified
- Environment variables MUST be validated
- OAuth redirect URIs MUST be configured correctly

### Security Review
- No secrets in code or git history
- HTTPS enforced in production configuration
- CSRF protection enabled and verified
- Session security settings validated

## Governance

### Amendment Process
1. Propose changes via documentation update
2. Validate against project goals (educational OAuth example)
3. Update constitution with version bump
4. Propagate changes to templates and workflows

### Versioning Policy
- MAJOR: Fundamental principle changes (e.g., removing security requirements)
- MINOR: New principles or significant expansions (e.g., adding CI/CD requirements)
- PATCH: Clarifications, corrections, formatting (e.g., fixing typos, improving examples)

### Compliance
- All features MUST align with Core Principles
- Template files MUST reference constitution checks
- Deviations MUST be justified in Complexity Tracking
- Constitution MUST be reviewed when project scope changes

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-10-03 | **Last Amended**: 2025-10-03
